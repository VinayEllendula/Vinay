I have built a SageMaker pipeline for LLM evaluation that supports multiple datasets, including Safety and Vanguard. Since the evaluation process takes several hours to run and SageMaker instances have a 240-minute limit, the pipeline ensures efficient orchestration and execution without manual intervention. Input data is sourced from S3, and the outputs are stored back in S3. A ‘General’ category is also created for future use, currently in a pending state.
