On-Call Rotation Example Based on India and US Team Availability

1. Overview
This document outlines a practical on-call rotation strategy based on time-zone specific availability. The India team will cover on-call duties during their regular working hours, while the US team will manage alerts outside of these hours to ensure full 24/7 incident response coverage.

2. India Team Coverage (Mon–Fri, 11:30 AM – 8:30 PM IST)
During Indian working hours (Mon–Fri, 11:30 AM – 8:30 PM IST), the India team will handle on-call responsibilities.
Team Members:
- Vinay
- Shashank

A weekly rotation is used to alternate responsibilities between Vinay and Shashank. If neither responds within the defined time, escalation will be made to their manager, Abhilas.

3. US Team Coverage (Outside IST Hours & Weekends)
The US team is responsible for covering all hours not handled by the India team:
- Weekdays outside 11:30 AM – 8:30 PM IST
- All weekends

This ensures uninterrupted incident response and global coverage.

4. Handoff & Escalation Strategy
To ensure proper incident management across time zones:
- PagerDuty schedules should be configured with time-based rules.
- Escalation policy:
 - During IST hours:
   1. Escalate to India Primary
   2. If no response, escalate to Backup
   3. If still no response, escalate to Abhilas (Manager)
 - Outside IST hours, escalate directly to US team
- Handoff between shifts happens daily at 8:30 PM IST.

5. Additional Notes
- Update PagerDuty schedules regularly to reflect holidays and availability changes.
- All users must configure their notification settings (push, SMS, phone call).
- Regular test alerts should be conducted to ensure alert delivery and acknowledgement.
